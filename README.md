Studies along the books "An Introduction to Statistical Learning", by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani; "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman; and the material of the subjects I studied in Numerical Algorithms, with professor (and my advisor) LÃºcia Catabriga.
